# Defaulter2 MVP Release Document

## 1. Executive Summary

Defaulter2 is designed to streamline the Unity asset pipeline by automatically applying consistent import settings based on configurable rules and presets. It aims to deliver:
- A central configuration system
- Rule-based filtering for intelligent asset targeting
- Automatic, non-blocking asset processing

This document outlines the core functionalities that have been implemented, identifies gaps for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), and defines the roadmap for upcoming improvements.

## 2. User Stories

### Core User Stories

#### Setup & Configuration
1. **As a Unity developer**, I want to create and manage import presets for different asset types, so that I can define standardized settings once and apply them consistently.
   ```
   Given I have opened the Defaulter2 window
   When I create a new preset for a specific asset type
   Then I should be able to configure all relevant import settings
   And save the preset for future use
   ```

2. **As a Unity developer**, I want to create a Defaulter2 configuration asset through the Defaulter2 window, so that I can easily access and manage the settings.
   ```
   Given I have opened the Defaulter2 window
   When I click the "Create Configuration" button
   Then a Defaulter2 ScriptableObject asset should be created in my project
   And the configuration settings should be displayed in the window
   ```

3. **As a Unity developer**, I want to define rules for when presets should be applied, so that the right settings are used for the right assets.
   ```
   Given I have created an import preset
   When I configure its filter settings (folders, name patterns, dimensions)
   Then the preset should only apply to matching assets
   ```

#### Asset Processing
4. **As a Unity developer**, I want assets to be automatically processed when imported (in a non-blocking way), so that I don't have to manually apply settings and the editor remains responsive.
   ```
   Given I have configured presets with filtering rules and auto mode is enabled
   When I import new assets into my project
   Then Defaulter2 should automatically apply the matching presets in a per-frame manner
   And a progress bar should be displayed in the Defaulter2 window
   ```

5. **As a Unity developer**, I want to manually validate and enforce settings on existing assets, so that I can ensure consistency in my project.
   ```
   Given I have existing assets in my project
   When I use the "Validate" or "Enforce" functions in Defaulter2
   Then I should see which assets need updating and optionally apply the changes
   ```

#### Project Panel Integration
6. **As a Unity developer**, I want to see which preset is affecting a specific asset directly in the Project panel, so that I can easily understand the configuration.
   ```
   Given I have assets in my project
   When I enable the "Show Preset Names" toggle in Defaulter2
   Then the name of the applied preset should be displayed under the asset icon in the Project panel (if the view mode is not "big icon preview")
   ```

## 3. Analysis of Implemented Features

## 4. Missing MVP Features

### Missing Features

#### Editor UI Improvements
- ❌ Defaulter2 window for asset creation and configuration
- ❌ Toggle flag to show/hide preset names in the Project panel
- ❌ Per-frame asset processing with progress bar

## 5. MVP Completion Roadmap

### High Priority
1. Implement the Defaulter2 window for asset creation and configuration
   - Create a new editor window class (Editor/Defaulter2Editor.cs)
   - Add a button to create the Defaulter2 ScriptableObject asset (Defaulter2Editor.cs)
   - Display the configuration settings in the window (Defaulter2Editor.cs)

2. Implement per-frame asset processing with progress bar
   - Modify the AssetPostprocessor to process assets in a non-blocking manner (Editor/Core/Defaulter2Processor.cs)
   - Display a progress bar in the Defaulter2 window (Editor/UI/DF2_EditorUI.cs)

3. Implement the toggle flag to show/hide preset names in the Project panel
   - Add a toggle in the Defaulter2 window (Editor/UI/DF2_EditorUI.cs)
   - Modify the Project panel to display the preset name when the toggle is enabled (Editor/Defaulter2Editor.cs, low-level Unity API)

## 6. Conclusion

The release of Defaulter2 establishes a solid foundation by delivering key functionalities for automating Unity asset import settings. The core filtering system, preset management, and automatic processing features provide immediate value to developers. Moving forward, focus will be placed on addressing the high-priority tasks to complete the UI improvements and ensure a smooth user experience. This iterative roadmap ensures that Defaulter2 evolves to meet the needs of Unity developers while remaining scalable and efficient.
