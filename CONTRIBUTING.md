# Contributing to RooFlow

Thank you for your interest in contributing to RooFlow! We welcome contributions from everyone.  This document outlines how to contribute to the project.

## Ways to Contribute

*   **Bug Reports:** If you find a bug, please open an issue on the GitHub repository, providing a clear description of the problem, steps to reproduce it, and your expected vs. actual results. Include the Roo version, VS Code version, and operating system.
*   **Feature Requests:**  If you have an idea for a new feature, open an issue on GitHub and describe the feature, its benefits, and any potential implementation details.
*   **Code Contributions:**  If you want to contribute code (bug fixes, new features, improvements), please follow these steps:
    1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create a fork of the RooFlow repository on GitHub.
    2.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your changes (e.g., `feature/my-new-feature` or `bugfix/issue-123`). Use descriptive branch names.
    3.  **Make Changes:** Make your changes, following the coding style and conventions of the project.
    4.  **Test Thoroughly:**  Ensure your changes work correctly and don't introduce new issues.  Test with and without an existing Memory Bank. Test the UMB command.
    5.  **Commit Changes:** Commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages.
    6.  **Push to Your Fork:** Push your branch to your forked repository.
    7.  **Create a Pull Request:** Create a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch of the RooFlow repository.  Clearly describe your changes and the problem they solve or the feature they add.
*   **Documentation:**  Improvements to the documentation (README, etc.) are also welcome. Follow the same process as for code contributions.

## Development Setup

To develop RooFlow, you'll need:

1.  **VS Code:**  Install Visual Studio Code.
2.  **Roo Code Extension:** Install the Roo Code extension from the VS Code Marketplace.
3.  **Git:**  Install Git for version control.
4.  **Node.js and npm (likely):** While RooFlow itself doesn't have *code* in the traditional sense, the Roo Code extension likely uses Node.js and npm for its build process.  If you're modifying the `system-prompt-[mode]` files, you *might* need to rebuild the extension.  Check the Roo Code documentation for specific instructions.

**Project Structure:**

The RooFlow project consists of the following files, which you should place in your project's root directory:

* `.roo/`: A directory containing the system prompts.
* `system-prompt-architect`: System prompt for Architect mode.
* `system-prompt-code`: System prompt for Code mode.
* `system-prompt-debug`: System prompt for Debug mode.
* `system-prompt-ask`: System prompt for Ask mode.
* `system-prompt-test`: System prompt for Test mode.
* `cline_custom_modes.json`: Defines an optional global Default mode.
* `.rooignore`: So Roo doesn't ignore .memory-bank/ if it's gitignored.
* `.roomodes`: Defines the custom Test mode.
* `README.md`:  This file.
* `projectBrief.md`: Optional project brief.

**Memory Bank:**

The `.memory-bank/` directory is created automatically by RooFlow.  Do *not* create it manually.

**Testing:**

*   **Test Thoroughly:**  Before submitting any changes, test them thoroughly in various scenarios.
*   **Memory Bank Presence/Absence:** Test with and without an existing Memory Bank.
*   **UMB Command:** Test the "Update Memory Bank" (UMB) command to ensure it works correctly.
*   **Mode Switching:** Test switching between different modes.
*   **Error Handling:** Test how RooFlow handles errors and unexpected situations.

## Coding Style

*   **YAML:**  The `system-prompt-[mode]` files use YAML format.  Use consistent indentation (2 spaces) and follow YAML best practices.
*   **Markdown:** The Memory Bank files (`.md`) use Markdown format.
*   **Clarity:**  Write clear, concise, and unambiguous instructions.
* **Comments**: Use comments within the YAML files to explain complex logic.

## Pull Request Guidelines

*   **Descriptive Title:** Use a clear and descriptive title for your pull request.
*   **Detailed Description:**  Provide a detailed description of your changes, including the motivation for the changes, the approach taken, and any relevant context.
*   **Link to Issue:** If your pull request addresses an existing issue, link to the issue in the description.
*   **Small, Focused Changes:**  Prefer smaller, focused pull requests over large, monolithic ones.
*   **Tests:** Include tests for any new functionality or bug fixes.
